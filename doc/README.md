# Project 1: 
### Doc folder

Please make sure you have forked the spring2018-project1-dca2123 repository before opening any of these files.

The doc directory contains the Python Notebook used to do the data analysis. This notebook provides an in depth look at the data.
You may have to install python in order to view this file. See main repp README for details.

#### To reproduce the .ipynb file: download anaconda, with jupyter notebook. Use Jupyter notebook to navigate to the repo and the docs folder. Then open the file.

#### Aditionally, if you already have Jupyter notebook downloaded, you can open the python notebook in Nbviewer. Just click hover over the circle in the upper right corner when viewing the notebook on git hub. Wait a little bit before opening in Nbviewer; the visualization needs time to load.

Checkpoints for each save during my analysis are included as well.

Finally, Professor Rush's rmd files are  included.
