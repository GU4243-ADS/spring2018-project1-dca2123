# Project 1: 
### Figs folder

The figs directory contains the figures. This directory only contains generated files; that is, one should always be able to delete the contents and regenerate them.

Contains bar charts from the sentiment analysis, and html files from the topic modeling. Github desktop is necessary to view the html 
files. See the main page README.

This file also contains Professor Rush's images.
