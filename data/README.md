# Project 1: 
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

The above is Professor Rush's voice. This file contains a csv of the SPOOKY data, which has labeled senteneces from Edgar ALLen Poe, Mary
Shelly, and HP Lovecraft.
